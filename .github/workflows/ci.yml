# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# .NET CI Workflow
#
# Purpose:
#   A secure, optimized CI pipeline for the .NET Tic Tac Toe microservices project.
#   Follows "build once, test the artifact" principle by building Docker images
#   and testing the actual containers that will be deployed.
#
# Security Features:
#   - Dependency vulnerability scanning using GitHub's dependency-review-action
#   - Secrets detection and prevention using TruffleHog
#   - Container vulnerability scanning using Trivy on built images
#   - Principle of Least Privilege token permissions
#   - Early security validation before build process
#
# Performance Features:
#   - Intelligent NuGet package caching for faster builds
#   - Separated test execution (unit vs integration) for efficiency
#   - Incremental builds with --no-restore optimization
#
# Quality Features:
#   - Code coverage collection with XPlat Code Coverage
#   - Static code analysis and quality gates
#   - Rich test result reporting in pull request interface
#   - Detailed artifacts for debugging and analysis
#   - 7-day artifact retention for post-analysis
#
# Workflow Jobs:
#   Job 1 (unit-tests): Fast feedback with unit tests only
#   Job 2 (build-and-integration-test): Build Docker images, scan them, and test live containers
