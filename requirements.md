# Backend Home Assignment / Distributed Tic Tac Toe Microservices

## Overview

In this assignment, you will build a distributed Tic Tac Toe application in which the game is played automatically by the microservices. The system is composed of three main components:

- **Game Engine Service**: Manages the core game logic, including board management, move validation, and determining game outcomes.
- **Game Session Service**: Oversees game sessions and automates moves for both players by coordinating with the Game Engine Service.
- **User Interface (UI)**: Provides a visual presentation of the game board and displays the progress of the automated game as the microservices play against each other.

## Project Requirements

### 1. Game Engine Service

**Objective**:  
Implement the core Tic Tac Toe logic to manage the game state.

**Responsibilities**:

- **Board Management**:  
  Maintain the current state of the game board.

- **Move Validation**:  
  Ensure that each move is legal (e.g., the target cell is unoccupied).

- **Game Outcome**:  
  Check for winning conditions or a draw after each move and report the current status.

**Key Endpoints**:

- `POST /games/{gameId}/move`  
  **Purpose**: Receive a move request containing the player symbol and board position.  
  **Functionality**:
    - Validate the move.
    - Update the game state.
    - Determine and return the current game status (in progress, win, or draw).

- `GET /games/{gameId}`  
  **Purpose**: Retrieve the current state of the game (board and status).

**Technical Requirements**:

- Use an in-memory data structure or in-memory database (e.g., `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory`, LiteDB, SQLite in in-memory mode via `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite`) for game state management.
- Implement robust error handling for invalid moves and end-of-game scenarios.

### 2. Game Session Service

**Objective**:  
Manage game sessions and automate the gameplay by generating moves for both players.

**Responsibilities**:

- **Session Management**:  
  Create and manage game sessions along with session details.

- **Automated Move Generation**:  
  Simulate moves for both players (e.g., using a simple random or rule-based algorithm) and forward these moves to the Game Engine Service.

- **Move Coordination**:  
  Receive responses from the Game Engine Service and update session data accordingly.

**Key Endpoints**:

- `POST /sessions`  
  **Purpose**: Create a new game session.  
  **Functionality**:
    - Generate a unique `sessionId` (which may also serve as the `gameId` for the Game Engine Service).
    - Optionally initialize the game state in the Game Engine Service.

- `POST /sessions/{sessionId}/simulate`  
  **Purpose**: Trigger the automated simulation of a game.  
  **Functionality**:
    - Automatically generate and forward moves to the Game Engine Service (alternating between players).
    - Continue simulation until the game concludes (win or draw).

- `GET /sessions/{sessionId}`  
  **Purpose**: Retrieve session details, including the current game state and move history.

**Technical Requirements**:

- Use an in-memory database (`Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory`, LiteDB, or SQLite in-memory mode) for storing session and move data.
- Ensure consistent communication with the Game Engine Service and robust error handling.

### 3. User Interface (UI)

**Objective**:  
Create a visual interface that displays the Tic Tac Toe board and presents the progress of the game as it is played automatically by the microservices.

**UI Responsibilities**:

- **Game Initialization**:
    - Display a “Start Simulation” button that triggers the automated game simulation via the Game Session Service.

- **Game Display**:
    - Render a 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board showing the current game state.
    - Update the board in real time as moves are made by the microservices.

- **Status and Feedback**:
    - Show the current game status (in progress, win, or draw).
    - Display a move history or log for reference.

- **Error Handling**:
    - Present appropriate error messages in case of backend or communication issues.

- **Real-Time Feedback (Optional)**:
    - Consider using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push live updates to the UI.

---

## Testing & Validation

- **Inter-Service Communication**:  
  Validate that the Game Session Service and Game Engine Service communicate effectively via REST APIs.

- **State Management**:  
  Ensure that the game state is accurately maintained and updated across components.

- **Error Handling**:  
  Implement graceful handling of invalid moves, simulation errors, and communication failures.

- **Integration Testing**:  
  Provide tests that simulate a full automated game flow: session creation, move simulation, and game outcome determination.

---

## Optional Enhancements

- **Concurrency Handling**:  
  Address scenarios where moves might be processed concurrently.

- **Service Discovery / API Gateway**:  
  Integrate solutions like YARP, Ocelot, Dapr, Istio (with Envoy) to simulate a production microservices environment.

- **Data Persistence**:  
  Although an in-memory database is acceptable, consider strategies for persistent storage and data recovery.

- **Real-Time Updates**:  
  Enhance the UI with real-time capabilities using WebSockets or SSE for a smoother experience.

---

## Submission Guidelines

- **Code Quality**:  
  Ensure your code is well-organized, commented, and adheres to .NET best practices and coding conventions.

- **Documentation**:  
  Include a README with detailed instructions on building, running, and testing your application.

- **Testing**:  
  Provide comprehensive integration tests to validate the application’s functionality.

- **Discussion**:  
  Optionally, include a brief discussion of potential improvements or alternative design approaches.

Good luck and happy coding!
